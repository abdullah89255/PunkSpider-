1. **Check Internet Connectivity**:
   Ensure that your machine has a working internet connection and can resolve domain names. Test it by running:

   ```bash
   ping google.com
   ```

2. **Set a Valid `--base-url`**:
   The script mentions setting a `--base-url`. Provide a valid URL that the script can connect to. For example:

   ```bash
   python3 Spider_Punk2.py evil.com -x --base-url https://valid-url.com
   ```

   Replace `https://valid-url.com` with the actual URL for the PunkSpider API or server you're trying to query.

3. **Use the `--mock` Flag**:
   If you are running in a testing environment or the actual service is unavailable, you can try the `--mock` flag as suggested:

   ```bash
   python3 Spider_Punk2.py evil.com -x --mock
   ```

4. **Verify the Script's Configuration**:
   If `https://hypothetical-punkspider.com` is hardcoded in the script, you might need to update it. Open the script and look for lines defining the base URL, like:

   ```python
   BASE_URL = "https://hypothetical-punkspider.com"
   ```

   Replace it with a valid URL.

5. **Check the Server**:
   Ensure that the service you're trying to connect to is up and running. You can try accessing the URL in a web browser or use a tool like `curl`:

   ```bash
   curl -I https://hypothetical-punkspider.com
   ```

6. **Debugging**:
   Run the script with verbose logging to get more details:

   ```bash
   python3 Spider_Punk2.py evil.com -x --verbose
   ```

If you provide more details about the purpose of the script or its expected configuration, I can assist further.
